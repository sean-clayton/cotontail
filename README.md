## A Gnome 3.14 Theme

### About

There were no themes I liked for the latest Gnome release. There were also no themes released under an open license other than GPL. This theme will fix that. I also intend on it using as many open-source principles as possible, using open standards and such.

### Screenshots

***NOT AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME***

### Customizing

This theme is made with SCSS. There are a ton of variables you can change. This will be expanded as code is written.
